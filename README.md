About our website:

p l a n t is a website that aids beginner gardeners in taking care of their plants. We decided to create p l a n t because a lot of beginner gardeners fail to take care of their plants because they often forget to water them. Our website reminds users when to water their plants, allowing your gardens to thrive. It is useful, convenient, universal and fun!
